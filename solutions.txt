Level 0 :
Username - natas0
Pass - natas0

Level 0 -1:
The password for the next level, natas1, is in the source code.
Username - natas1
Pass - gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto

Level 1 -2 :
The password is in the source code but, the right click is blocked. On using ctrl + u or adding view-source before the url we can view the source code.
Username - natas2
Pass - ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi

Natas 2 -3:
They say there is nothing here, but viewing the source code we’ll know that the img src is from some folder files.on checking files we’ll get a users.txt file that has the pass.
Username - natas3
Pass - sJIJNW6ucpu6HPZ1ZAchaDtwd7oGrD14

Level 3 -4 :
There is nothing in the source code so, we have to search for some secret.txt or robots.txt ….
There is a file robots.txt with some path /s3cr3t/ when we go to that page, we’ll have users.txt which has the pass for the next level.
Username - natas4
Pass - Z9tkRkWmpt9Qr7XrR5jWRkgOU901swEZ

Level 4 -5:
Those who enter through natas5 will see the pass and so, using burp suite we can change that in the referer link Then we’ll get the pass
Username - natas5  
Pass - iX6IOfmpN7AYOQGPwtn3fXpbaJVJcHfq

Level 5 -6:
Access denied, if we check for more info in the cookies, there is a parameter “loggedin” that is marked as 0(false) on changing that to 1(true) we are logged in
Username - natas6
Pass - aGoY4q2Dc6MgDq4oL4YtoKtyAg9PeHa1

Level 6 -7:
When we see the source code we’ll know that “/include/secret.inc “ is included, when that page source is viewed we’ll get the secret, and on submitting the secret we’ll get the pass
Username - natas7
Pass - 7z3hEENjQtflzgnT29q7wAvMNfZdh0i9

Level 7 -8:
In the source code hint is given that the pass is in /etc/web_pass/natas8
When we change url to ?page=/etc/web_pass/natas8 we’ll get the pass
Username - natas8
Pass - DBfUBfqQG69KvJvJ1iAbMoIpwSNQ9bWe 

Level 8 -9:
On viewing the source code we know how to get the secret from the encoded secret. we’ll get the secret as - oubWYf2kBq on submitting the secret we get the pass
Username - natas9
Pass - W0mMhUcRRnG8dcghE4qvk3JA9lGt8nDl

Level 9-10:
In the source code, they used “passthru” that executes the commands so we use “ls” to get the password
Username - natas10
Cmd - ;ls /etc/web_pass
;cat /etc/web_pass/natas10
Pass - nOpp1igQAkUzaI1GUUjzn1bFVj7xCNzu

Level 10 - 11:
On viewing the source code just like before, preg_martch is used to avoid using “;”. so, we cannot run multiple commands at a time so, we make use of grep command. Grep command can be used to search a string in multiple files at a time so we give the following command and if the letter is in both the pass and dictionary word then we’ll get the pass.
Cmd - a /etc/natas_webpass/natas11
Instead of trying out for all the 26 alphabets I did with numbers, because there will at least be one number in the password and 10 is easier than 26.
Username - natas11
Pass - U82q5TCMMQ9xuFoI3dYX61s7OZD9JKoK

Level 11- 12:
 In the source code, we’ll see that if [”showpassword”]==”yes” then we’ll get the pass for the next level. then there is a function to load data and to set cookies. we have the default plain text and cipher text(from the cookies) but the key is not given. so we can xor plain text and cipher text to get the key.
Key - qw8J
Then we’ll change the plain text from array( "showpassword"=>"no", "bgcolor"=>"#ffffff"); to array( "showpassword"=>"yes", "bgcolor"=>"#ffffff"); and xor it with the key then we’ll get the ciphertext.
Cipher text = ClVLIh4ASCsCBE8lAxMacFMOXTlTWxooFhRXJh4FGnBTVF4sFxFeLFMK
This cipher text will be replaced with the current cookie so, the condition "showpassword"=>"yes" will be true and the pass will be displayed on the screen
Username - natas12
Pass - EDXp0pS26wLKHZy1rDBPUZk0RKfLGIR3

Level 12 - 13:
They say to upload a JPEG file, and its max size is 1kb. After we upload a file they’ll give us the path and name where it is stored. This is an LFI. if we’ll upload a php file, change its extension using burp and get the path where it is stored.
Php code - 
<?php
     passthru($_GET[‘cmd’]);
?>
This will take any command given through get and execute them. Then in the url go to that page and also give commands like - cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13
We’ll get the pass
Username - natas13
Pass - jmLTY0qiPZBbaKc9341cqPQZBJv7MQbY

Level 13 -14:
This is similar to the previous one but, just changing the extension will not help as it checks for the magic numbers and then decides if it is a JPEG file or not. So, we have to include the magic number of jpg in the code that will pass through the condition.
Php code - 
 ÿØÿà
<?
	readfile('/etc/natas_webpass/natas14');
?>
Username - natas14
Pass - Lg96M10TdfaPyVBkJdjymbllQ5L6qdl1

Level 14-15 :
View the source code and we can know that MySQL is being used and we’ll get an error with “ and so with a script, we can get the pass
Sql - “or1=1-- -
Username - natas15
Pass - AwWj0w5cvxrZiONgZ9J5stNVkmxdk39J

Level 15 - 16:
When given normal SQL as before we get “the user exists” and nothing else so, to get the password for natas16 we need to dump the database and get the password through a Python script.
Username - natas16
Pass - WaIHEacj63wnNIBROHeqi3p9t0m5nhmh
